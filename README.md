# WoT Relay

WOT Relay is a Nostr relay that saves all the notes that people you follow, and people they follow are posting. It's built on the [Khatru](https://khatru.nostr.technology) framework.

# Available Relays

Don't want to run the relay, just want to connect to some? Here are some available relays:

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Build Essentials**: If you're using Linux, you may need to install build essentials. You can do this by running `sudo apt install build-essential`.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the WOT Relay running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bitvora/wot-relay.git
cd wot-relay
```

### 2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

You'll need to create an `.env` file based on the example provided in the repository.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Set your environment variables

Open the `.env` file and set the necessary environment variables. Example variables include:

```bash
RELAY_NAME="YourRelayName"
RELAY_PUBKEY="YourPublicKey" # the owner's hexkey, not npub. Convert npub to hex here: https://nostrcheck.me/converter/
RELAY_DESCRIPTION="Your relay description"
DB_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/db" # any path you would like the database to be saved.
INDEX_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/templates/index.html" # path to the index.html file
STATIC_PATH="/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/templates/static" # path to the static folder
REFRESH_INTERVAL_HOURS=24 # interval in hours to refresh the web of trust
MINIMUM_FOLLOWERS=3 #how many followers before they're allowed in the WoT
ARCHIVAL_SYNC="FALSE" # set to TRUE to archive every note from every person in the WoT (not recommended)
ARCHIVE_REACTIONS="FALSE" # set to TRUE to archive every reaction from every person in the WoT (not recommended)
IGNORE_FOLLOWS_LIST="" # comma separated list of pubkeys who follow too many bots and ruin the WoT
SEED_RELAYS="" # optional, comma separated WSS URLs for seed relays (uses built-in defaults if empty)
ARCHIVE_KINDS="" # optional, comma separated event kind numbers to archive (uses defaults if empty)
```

### 4. Build the project

Run the following command to build the relay:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git describe --tags --always)"
```

### 5. Create a Systemd Service (optional)

To have the relay run as a service, create a systemd unit file. Make sure to limit the memory usage to less than your system's total memory to prevent the relay from crashing the system.

1. Create the file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/wot-relay.service
```

2. Add the following contents:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=WOT Relay Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/wot-relay/wot-relay
WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/wot-relay
Restart=always
MemoryLimit=2G

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual paths where you cloned the repository and stored the `.env` file.

3. Reload systemd to recognize the new service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start wot-relay
```

5. (Optional) Enable the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wot-relay
```

#### Permission Issues on Some Systems

the relay may not have permissions to read and write to the database. To fix this, you can change the permissions of the database folder:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /path/to/db
```

### 6. Serving over nginx (optional)

You can serve the relay over nginx by adding the following configuration to your nginx configuration file:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3334;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

After adding the configuration, restart nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 7. Install Certbot (optional)

If you want to serve the relay over HTTPS, you can use Certbot to generate an SSL certificate.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

After installing Certbot, run the following command to generate an SSL certificate:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the instructions to generate the certificate.

### 8. Access the relay

Once everything is set up, the relay will be running on `localhost:3334` or your domain name if you set up nginx.

## Start the Project with Docker Compose

To start the project using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure the `.env` file is present in the project directory and has the necessary environment variables set.
4. You can also change the paths of the `db` folder and `templates` folder in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - "./db:/app/db" # only change the left side before the colon
     - "./templates/index.html:${INDEX_PATH}" # only change the left side before the colon
     - "./templates/static:${INDEX_PATH}" # only change the left side before the colon
   ```

5. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   # in foreground
   docker compose up --build
   # in background
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

6. For updating the relay, run the following command:

   ```sh
   git pull
   docker compose build --no-cache
   # in foreground
   docker compose up
   # in background
   docker compose up -d
   ```

This will build the Docker image and start the `wot-relay` service as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The application will be accessible on port 3334.

### 7. Hidden Service with Tor (optional)

Same as the step 6, but with the following command:

```sh
# in foreground
docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up --build
# in background
docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up --build -d
```

You can find the onion address here: `tor/data/relay/hostname`

### 8. Access the relay

Once everything is set up, the relay will be running on `localhost:3334`.

```bash
http://localhost:3334
```

## Monthly zap funding goal (optional)

The relay can run as a **community funded relay**. Instead of charging every user, it sets a monthly
goal (say 100,000 sats). Until the web of trust has zapped that amount, the relay refuses all writes
and tells clients it is `payment_required`. As soon as the goal is met, everyone in the web of trust
can write for free until the 1st of the next month, when the goal resets.

How it works:

- On boot (and on the 1st of every month) the relay publishes a [NIP-75](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/75.md)
  zap goal (kind `9041`) signed by a dedicated **funding identity** key, plus a kind `0` profile for
  that key carrying your lightning address. The goal is broadcast to the seed relays so it shows up
  in clients that render zap goals (Amethyst does).
- People zap the goal from the relay's web page (QR code, `lightning:` link, WebLN, or signed with a
  NIP-07 extension so the zap is attributed to them) or from any nostr client.
- The relay accepts kind `9735` zap receipts for the goal from your lightning address's LNURL provider
  (the `nostrPubkey` it advertises), verifies the embedded zap request, and tallies them. It also
  follows the seed relays for receipts in case the provider could not deliver them directly.
- While the goal is unmet (after the grace period) every `EVENT` is rejected with a `blocked:` reason
  pointing at the web page, and the NIP-11 document carries `limitation.payment_required: true`,
  `fees.subscription` and `payments_url`. Once funded, `payment_required` flips to `false` and the fees
  disappear. `restricted_writes` is always `true` because this is a web-of-trust relay. Clients cache
  NIP-11, so the change can take a few minutes to show up in-app. Reads are never restricted.
- `GET /funding.json` exposes the live state (goal, raised, locked, period, goal `nevent`, top
  supporters). `POST /funding/invoice` with `{"amount_sats": 2100, "comment": "..."}` returns a bolt11
  invoice for a zap to the goal; pass a browser-signed kind `9734` as `zap_request` to attribute it.

Configuration (all optional, the feature is off unless `FUNDING_GOAL_SATS` is set):

```bash
FUNDING_GOAL_SATS=100000                    # sats to raise each month; 0/unset disables the feature
FUNDING_SECRET_KEY="<hex or nsec>"          # a NEW key for the funding identity, never your own nsec
FUNDING_LIGHTNING_ADDRESS="you@getalby.com" # must support nostr zaps (allowsNostr=true)
FUNDING_GRACE_DAYS=3                        # writes stay open this many days into each month (default 3)
FUNDING_TIMEZONE="UTC"                      # IANA zone for month boundaries (default UTC)
FUNDING_NAME=""                             # profile name of the funding identity (default "<RELAY_NAME> Fund")
FUNDING_RELAYS=""                           # relays receipts are delivered to / tallied from (default: seed relays minus profile-only ones)
```

Generate a fresh key for `FUNDING_SECRET_KEY`, for example with `openssl rand -hex 32` or `nak key generate`.
The relay logs the resulting npub on boot. The zaps land in the wallet behind
`FUNDING_LIGHTNING_ADDRESS`; the relay never touches funds, it only counts receipts.

Surplus does not carry over: every month starts again at zero.

## Migrating from Badger to LMDB

Older versions of wot-relay stored events in a Badger database. The relay now
uses LMDB via `fiatjaf.com/nostr/eventstore/lmdb` and Badger is no longer
supported. Because the two backends use different on-disk formats, an
in-place upgrade is not possible — events must be exported to JSONL from the
old store and re-imported into a fresh LMDB store.

1. Stop the relay.
2. Build the legacy exporter (separate module, uses the old Badger code):

   ```bash
   cd tools/export-badger
   go build -o ../../export-badger .
   cd ../..
   ```
3. Export every event to JSONL:

   ```bash
   ./export-badger -db ./db > events.jsonl
   ```
4. Move the old database aside (keep it until the new one is verified):

   ```bash
   mv ./db ./db.badger.bak
   ```
5. Build the new relay and importer:

   ```bash
   go build -ldflags "-X main.version=$(git describe --tags --always)"
   go build -o import-jsonl ./cmd/import-jsonl
   ```
6. Populate a fresh LMDB directory:

   ```bash
   ./import-jsonl -db ./db < events.jsonl
   ```
7. Start the relay as normal. `DB_PATH` now points at the LMDB directory.

### Migrating with Docker

If you run wot-relay via Docker Compose, you don't need Go installed on the
host — the steps above can be run inside the `golang:bookworm` image against
the same `./db` bind mount your compose file already uses.

1. Stop the relay:

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```
2. Export the Badger DB to JSONL:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src golang:bookworm sh -c \
       "cd tools/export-badger && go build -o /tmp/export-badger . && /tmp/export-badger -db /src/db > /src/events.jsonl"
   ```
3. Move the old database aside:

   ```bash
   mv db db.badger.bak
   ```
4. Import the JSONL into a fresh LMDB directory:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src golang:bookworm sh -c \
       "go build -o /tmp/import-jsonl ./cmd/import-jsonl && /tmp/import-jsonl -db /src/db < /src/events.jsonl"
   ```
5. Rebuild and start the relay:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

Files written by the `docker run` steps will be owned by root on the host
because the container runs as root by default. If that's a problem, `chown`
them back after migration.
